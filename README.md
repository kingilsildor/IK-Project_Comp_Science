# **Course: Computational Modelling Project**

---

## **Objectives**

- Formulate a **phenomenological model** for a simple physical, biological, or socio-economic process.  
- Select a **mathematical or computational model** based on the phenomenological model.  
- Choose and justify a **computational approach** to implement the model.  
- Implement the model as an **executable computer program**.  
- Design and perform **computer simulation experiments**.  
- Interpret and explain simulation results with respect to a **research question**.  

---

## **Contents**

In this project, students will design, implement, and test a **simulation program** for a computational problem of their choosing. The program will be used to perform experiments, interpret results, and present findings under the guidance of an experienced researcher.  

Key aspects include:  
1. **Analytical Skills** - Constructing and analyzing simulation models.  
2. **Implementation** - Programming the model (not the dominant component).  
3. **Numerical Experimentation** - Performing and analyzing simulations.  
4. **Final Deliverables** - Report and presentation, possibly including a demo.  

---

## **Recommended Prior Knowledge**

- **Programming Experience**: C, Java, or Python.  
- **Mathematics**: Equivalent to "Wiskunde B" level.  
- **Statistics and Numerical Simulations**: Background knowledge required.  
- Informatics students can meet prerequisites through:  
  - *Introduction Computational Science*  
  - *Statistisch Redeneren*

- Other students (including bachelor Informatics) must contact the coordinator to verify eligibility.  

---

## **Assessment**

The **final grade** is based on:  
1. **Report** - Scientific quality, code quality, and participation.  
2. **Presentation** - Poster and discussion (may include a demo).  

---

## **Remarks**

- **Full-time Commitment Required** - Avoid scheduling with other courses.  
- **Mandatory Attendance** -  
  - Allowed **1 absence** with prior notice and valid reason.  
  - Each unnotified absence deducts **20%** from participation marks.  
- **Language** - Lectures, guidance, and materials are in **English**.
